    <h1>All about Ollie!</h1>
    <h2>Who is Ollie?</h2>
    <p>Ollie is Manav Khosla's dog. He is a cavalier king charles spaniel dog breed. 
        <br>He was born on August 12 and he loves all people. 
        He is currently 6 months <br>old and is considered a puppy.</p>
    
    <h2>What does Ollie like to do?</h2>
    <p>Since Ollie is a puppy he has lots of energy. This means he loves to play! 
        Some<br> things we play with Ollie are fetch, tug of war and we do puppy training with him <br> with 
        our doggy treats. We taught Ollie how to sit and stay. 
        For example, if we were<br> to place a treat in front of Ollie and said stay,
         he would not move until we said eat.</p>

    <h2>What does Ollie require?</h2>
    <p>As fun as Ollie is he has lots of work. We have to take Ollie on walks every day for<br> at least
        60 minutes. We also have to give him food during the day and finally we have <br>to take Ollie outside
        to go to the bathroom multiple times during the day.
